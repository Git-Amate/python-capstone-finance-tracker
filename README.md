Personal Finance Tracker

Brief Project Description

The Personal Finance Tracker is a simple command-line application written in Python that allows users to:
Log expenses with a description, category, and amount.
Organize expenses by categories.
View a list of all logged expenses.
See a summary of total spending per category.
Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
This project simulates a basic real-world financial tracking task and demonstrates core Python programming skills.

Python Concepts Used
Variables and Data Types: strings, floats, tuples, lists, dictionaries.
Functions: modular structure using defined functions (add_expense, view_expenses, view_summary, etc.).
Control Structures: if, else, while, and for loops.
Exception Handling: try, except, and finally blocks to manage user input errors.
String Operations: formatting, joining, case normalization.
Data Structures:
Tuples: to store individual expenses (description, amount).
Dictionaries: to group expenses by category.
Lists: to manage multiple expenses under the same category.
